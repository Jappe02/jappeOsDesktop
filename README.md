# NOTE: THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN MOVED TO Jappe-OS/JappeOS

# JappeOsDesktop

Jappe os desktop is the desktop environment for Jappe os.
This desktop environment is coded with flutter,
and includes the whole desktop environment code in this github repository.
Currently Jappe studios is developing on it, so this readme doesn't include much.

# In development

Jappe os desktop is now in development by jappe studios, so, only alpha testers
have access to the desktop environment.

## Devlog

The jappe os discord has a devlog channel where you can see new things added to
Jappe os.
